# Random Walks on Networks: Extreme Event Analysis

This repository contains a computational study of random walk dynamics on
complex networks, with a focus on the statistics of extreme events. The project
uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate visit statistics and analyzes how the
probability of rare events depends on network topology.

# Methods
- Erdős–Renyi random networks
- Unbiased random walk dynamics
- Monte Carlo ensemble averaging
- Node-wise extreme event definition (μ + 3σ threshold)
- Conditional averaging by node degree

# Tools & Skills
- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- NetworkX
- Data analysis & visualization
- Statistical modeling
- Computational simulation pipelines

# Key Result
The analysis suggests that nodes with lower degree can exhibit a higher
probability of extreme events relative to their mean activity, highlighting the
role of network heterogeneity in rare-event statistics!!

# Motivation
This project was inspired by research on extreme events in random walk dynamics
on networks and aims to bridge computational physics methods with data-driven
analysis approaches.
